Sure, here's an updated README.md file with instructions on how to use the iCarly task scheduler tool:

# iCaly Task Scheduler

iCaly is a task scheduler tool that helps you manage your daily tasks and create an optimized schedule based on task priorities and due dates. It takes a CSV file containing task names, priorities, due dates and durations and outputs an iCalendar (.ics) file that can be imported into most calendar applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/icaly-task-scheduler.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd icaly-task-scheduler
   ```
3. Install the required packages using pip.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Create a CSV file named `tasks.csv` with columns for task name, priority, and duration in hours. For example:

   ```
   Task Name,Priority,Duration
   Task 1,1,2
   Task 2,3,1.5
   Task 3,2,3
   ```

   Note: If a task's duration exceeds the remaining time in the day, it will not be included in the schedule. The tool assumes that tasks can be scheduled from 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM. Tasks are sorted by due date and priority, with higher priority tasks taking precedence.

2. Run the script `icaly.py`.
   ```
   python icaly.py
   ```
3. The tool will output an iCalendar file named `schedule.ics` in the project directory.
4. Import the iCalendar file into your preferred calendar application by selecting "Import Calendar" and selecting the file.

## Example Output

Here's an example of what the iCalendar file generated by the iCaly Scheduler might look like:
